== Mercurial, not Subversion! ==

We use the distributed version control system Mercurial for our source code control instead of svn. Since GoogleCode only supports svn, we use freehg.org to host our sourcecode.


== How to get the source ==

To simply browse through the source code, go to http://freehg.org/u/mercurysquad/intelenhancedspeedstep/ â€“ The _manifest_ will show you the files in the project which you can browse through.

To download the source code for building yourself, or making changes, you need to install Mercurial. Download Mercurial from here: http://mercurial.berkwood.com/  Once you have it installed, start a terminal, go to the folder where you keep your source code etc. and type:

{{{
hg clone http://freehg.org/u/mercurysquad/intelenhancedspeedstep
}}}

This will clone our repository, ready for your to hack on. Once you're done making changes, do: 
{{{
hg commit
hg export tip > filename.diff
}}}

Then attach it and post it to use from the Issues page! More info on how to use Mercurial is at http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/QuickStart
