== Current feature plan ==

  # Implement in-kernel auto-throttle (ref. AutoThrottle)
  # Add IOUserClient based communication channel for userspace clients - perhaps use Mach RPC or ports instead? sysctl is not suitable for low-latency communication between userspace and kernel.
  # Add more sysctl variables for information purposes
  # Add sysctl control to enable/disable DebugMessages mode.
  # Add sysctl control for KernelFeatures
